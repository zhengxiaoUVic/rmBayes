Description: A Bayesian credible interval is interpreted with respect to posterior probability, 
    and this interpretation is far more intuitive than that of a frequentist confidence interval. 
    However, standard highest-density intervals can be wide due to between-subjects variability and tends 
    to hide within-subject effects, rendering its relationship with the Bayes factor less clear 
    in within-subject (repeated-measures) designs. 
    This urgent issue can be addressed by using within-subject intervals in within-subject designs, 
    which integrate four methods including the Wei-Nathoo-Masson (2023) <doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02295-1>, 
    the Loftus-Masson (1994) <doi:10.3758/BF03210951>, 
    the Nathoo-Kilshaw-Masson (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2018.07.005>, 
    and the Heck (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/whp8t> interval estimates.
