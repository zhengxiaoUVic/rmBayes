Description: A Bayesian credible interval is interpreted with respect to posterior probability, 
    and this interpretation is far more intuitive than that of a frequentist confidence interval. 
    However, standard highest-density intervals can be wide due to between-subjects variability and tends 
    to hide within-subjects effects, rendering its relationship with the Bayes factor less clear 
    in within-subjects (repeated-measures) designs. 
    This urgent issue can be addressed by using within-subjects intervals in within-subjects designs, 
    which integretate the methods proposed in Loftus-Masson (1994) <doi:10.3758/BF03210951>, 
    Rouder-Morey-Speckman-Province (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2012.08.001>, 
    Nathoo-Kilshaw-Masson (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2018.07.005>, 
    and Heck (2019) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/whp8t>.
