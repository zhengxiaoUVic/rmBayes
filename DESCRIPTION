Description: A Bayesian credible interval is interpreted with respect to posterior probability, 
    and this interpretation is far more intuitive than that of a frequentist confidence interval. 
    However, standard highest-density intervals can be wide due to between-subjects variability and tends 
    to hide within-subjects effects, rendering its relationship with the Bayes factor less clear 
    in within-subjects (repeated-measures) designs. 
    This urgent issue can be addressed by using within-subjects intervals in within-subjects designs.
